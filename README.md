# üêç Python Learning Journey: From Basics to Real-World Projects

Welcome to my Python journey! This repository contains my structured, step-by-step progress in learning Python ‚Äî from foundational concepts to real-world applications. I've divided the learning into **three major phases**, each captured in its own Jupyter Notebook.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository is part of my commitment to master Python for data science, AI, and automation. My goal is to gain a strong foundation in Python and apply it to real-world problems, especially in biomedical and healthcare domains.

The journey is broken into **3 notebooks**:

- ‚úÖ `Phase_1_Theory.ipynb` ‚Äî Python Basics  
- ‚úÖ `phase_2.ipynb` ‚Äî Core Programming Concepts  
- ‚úÖ `phase_3.ipynb` ‚Äî Popular Libraries & Real-World Tasks
